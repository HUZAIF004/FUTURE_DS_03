## Project Overview

**Objective:** Turn raw student feedback into actionable insights and an interactive dashboard.

**Key Questions:**

- What is the overall satisfaction level and distribution?  
- Which categories are top/bottom rated?  
- Which aspects move together?  
- What are the indicative sentiments in comments? (synthetic demo)  
- Are there distinct student cohorts based on rating patterns?

**Deliverables:**

- Cleaned datasets in `data/`  
- Visual assets in `assets/`  
- Jupyter notebook with documented phases  
- Streamlit app (`app.py`)
